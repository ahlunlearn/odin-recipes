<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Using this simple 'crepe cake' technique, you can turn any of your favorite cake fillings into visually stunning, multi-layered masterpieces.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) jar strawberry jam</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>¾ cup mascarpone cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pour eggs, flour, sugar, salt, oil, milk, and vanilla extract into a blender. Blend, starting on low speed and finishing on high, until combined. Refrigerate batter for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Scoop strawberry jam into a saucepan. Rinse out jar with water and pour into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir. Simmer for 1 minute, remove from heat, and stir. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Brush some butter over a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in 1/4 cup batter; tilt pan to coat evenly. Cook until crepes bubble and brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining batter, buttering the pan between crepes. Let cool completely before stacking, at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine mascarpone cheese, cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Whisk together until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Lay a crepe onto a large plate. Spoon on 2 or 3 tablespoons of the cream mixture, spreading it almost to the edge. Swirl in some strawberry jam. Transfer finished crepe onto a flat serving plate. Repeat with remaining crepes, cream, and jam. Center each crepe over the previous one in a stack. Gently press on a final plain crepe to finish.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate until completely chilled before cutting and serving.</li>
